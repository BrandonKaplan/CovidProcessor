CLASS: CSC 372 - Comparative Programming Spring 2022
PROJECT: Program one
DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the efficiency of Julia
by utlizing it's capabilities of large mathematical computations and big data sets
through computing various statistics based on data for COVID-19. This program uses 
two different csv files that contains between 82,000 to 125,000 different data lines
on vaccine data and hospitalization data. The user can explore either of these sets
or time the program on how long it takes to perform the computations. Within each of
the commands for the data, the user can get the statistic for group/country, get the
average for the datasets, get the top ten highest and lowest vaccinated/hospitalization.

TO RUN: Run this file, ProjectOneMain.jl
